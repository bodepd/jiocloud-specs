# intro

This repository is intended to hold specifications which are intended to propose
and discuss solutions to problems. The intention is to help additional team
members work on more complicated feature sets by allowing them to either
work off of an approved specification or create a specification to be accepted
by the community.

# Starting a new spec

1. Copy the example.md file to a file for your specification.
2. Fill in relevant data.
3. Submit a pull request

# Collaborating on specification (and getting specifications accepted)

Specification review, collaboration, and acceptance will occur via github
pull requests. The hope is that we can use pull request comments to discuss
specifications and merge them when they are accepted.

This repo is a bit of an experimentation is itself, so it will be interesting to
see what happens.
